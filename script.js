Question 4:
Create a base class of GameMember and 2 children classes of Dealer, Player
both dealer and player have:
hand : array of 2 numbers (1-13) ex: [5, 12] which starts with 2 random numbers
hit() : ability to add  a random number [1-13] to their hand
When a Dealer trys to hit he can only hit if he has his hand adds up to less than a total of 17 (so 16 and under)
When a Player hits they can hit as long as their total is under 21
Use the randomNumber function provided below to gernerate a random number 1-12
